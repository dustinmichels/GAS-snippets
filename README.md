## About

[Google Scripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) allow you to combine Google services in powerful ways using JavaScript. Youn can write scripts to:

- Extend the functionality of services like Google Sheets, adding menu buttons and macros, or configuring automated tasks.
- Orchestrate tasks that combine Google services (eg, get data from a Google Sheet and use it to create a Google Calendar event and sent an email with Gmail.)
- Rapidly deploy scripts that run on a timer, or in response to user events.

This is a collection of scripts I have written, made as legible and reusable as possible. Feel free to use them in your projects.

## How to use

I usually develop scripts locally, in TypeScript, then compile them into GAS-comptatible JavaScript using [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp). When I share code here, I will try to share the original TypeScript version and the compiled, JavaScript version.

- If you use clasp, copy the TypeScript code.
- If not, copy the plain JavaScript code into `.gs` files in the online editor.
